# Software Requirements  

## Vision  

- Our vision for this product is a fun memory game that anyone can play. We want a High Scores board, a game page, an about us page. We will ask the new uesr for their name to associate with a score.  

- This product will solve the "pain point" of entertainment. We want to make a simple game that will allow users to match 2 images, in turn helping to improve visual recognition.  

- This memory game is for all ages to enjoy! It may be used to occupy time or the mind!  

## Scope IN  

- This app will take user input "name" and associate it with a score  
- This app will increase the score based on matched photos  
- This app will decrease turns based on missed matches  
- This app will display high scores on the main page  
- We will have navigation buttons to move between pages  

## Scope OUT  

- Our website will never cause a computer to crash  
- The data collected in our webpage will not be used with malicious intent  

## MVP

- Users will be able to navigate between pages and the score will update and remain on the main page
